If you have installed pyRevit, and the installation completed with no errors but pyRevit doesn't load, please run the command below in terminal / command line. This should fix the issue on your machine, however, please continue filing the issue with instructions below.

👉 `pyrevit attach master 2711 --installed`

If it does not work, try to disable your revit addins, all of them. Then, one at a time, reactivate them and restart Revit to figure out which one is interacting badly with pyRevit and Report.
